# Building and Deploying a Containerized Application with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

I built and deployed a containerized application using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). I created an Amazon EKS cluster, prepared a Docker application and pushed it to an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository. I also deployed an AWS Load Balancer Controller and deployed the application into the Amazon EKS cluster. Finally, I configured and viewed Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights on the Kubernetes cluster

## Tasks

Task 1: Preparing the AWS Cloud9 workspace

Task 2: Creating the Amazon EKS cluster

Task 3: Creating Docker images

Task 4: Creating an Amazon ECR repository and pushing the Docker image to it
